- ✅ Make sure that no errors or warnings are hidden in e2e tests because of subprocess launch
- ✅ Revived and updated GitHub Actions CI workflow for FastAPI
- split workflow into individual scripts that can be run on their own
- run pip freeze
- unify env variables used across scripts, a  lot repetitions with different names
- remove redundancy with respect to requirements.txt and .env variables (we have script for that), as well as src directory
- it created a new script in fastapi_src/start.sh it should be moved and adjusted to the structure we use in scripts/
- choose better names for scripts, e.g. start.sh is not very descriptive in scripts/ directory, also there seems to be duplication between scripts please fix it
- ✅ Fixed test timeouts and overcomplicated options
- ✅ Created clean test framework based on test_e2e_prev pattern
- ✅ Tests gracefully skip when database is not available
- ✅ If any env variables are needed should be setup automatically by the tests
- we probably can get rid of .env.example
